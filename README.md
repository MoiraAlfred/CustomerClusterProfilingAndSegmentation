# Customer Segmentation and CRM Optimization Using Business Intelligence

## Project Overview  
This project applies Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Change Management (CM) principles using Business Intelligence (BI) techniques to analyze banking transaction data. It focuses on enhancing customer engagement, retention, and targeted marketing through structured data-driven insights.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Understanding**  
  Cleaned a dataset with over 1 million banking transactions by handling null, invalid, and abnormal values, including customer birth dates and transaction amounts.

- **RFM Analysis**  
  Conducted Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis to quantify customer behavior. Log transformation was used to normalize skewed data.

- **Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering**  
  Segmented customers into 10 groups based on RFM metrics using the K-Means algorithm. Optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, Gap Statistic, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.

- **Cluster Profiling and Location-Based Insights**  
  Interpreted cluster characteristics and linked them to high-transaction cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi to tailor CRM strategies.

- **Data Mart Design**  
  Designed a dimensional data model with Customer, Time, Location, and Cluster dimensions. Key performance measures include:
  - Total Transaction Value
  - Transaction Count
  - Average Transaction Value
  - Transaction Frequency

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Dimensional Modeling Principles  

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the application of analytical techniques to support strategic decision-making in a banking context. It offers a scalable approach to customer segmentation and lays the foundation for data-driven marketing, customer management, and operational planning.
